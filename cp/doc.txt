Got the following results from a pd (pure data) app:

Indevidual notes was still distinguisable up to about 10 Hz.
I could still hear the notes at up to about 30 Hz.
Above 30 Hz there was a note.

Thus cronos protos is about 10 Hz.

10 Hz * 60 seconds = 600 PPM.

120 BPM => 480 QNPM => 1/8 QNPS
1/8 QNPS * 8 Hz => 1 PPQN
